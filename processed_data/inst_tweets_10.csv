28,"For Domchek, treating patient-families like theirs is part of a unique style of care at the Basser Center. It feels, she says, as if her practice hearkens back to old-style family physicians who saw multiple generations of patients."
29,"The three sisters all feel a connection with Domchek, who takes time to answer every question they have about their follow-up care and about ongoing research on BRCA that could benefit their children."

31,"A ripple effect was seeing her youngest sister, Jen Schmidt, begin breast cancer treatment while she was still undergoing her own. As time went on, the shared BRCA experience also brought the sisters together."
32,"For Laura Temple, the discovery of her BRCA mutation during cancer treatment meant, first, pursuing a more aggressive course to prevent future cancers—a double mastectomy, when initially she’d hoped for a “band-aid” lumpectomy."

69,"Before the flu epidemic ended, the illness swept the globe. An estimated 50 to 100 million people died worldwide—and one-third of the total human population was sickened. Philadelphia, the hardest-hit American city, got the brunt of the illness."
70,"“After gasping for several hours they became delirious and incontinent, and many died struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth,” Starr wrote. “It was a dreadful business.”"
71,"Soon the patients poured in. At first, nobody on Starr’s floor was very ill—the patients had fever but little else wrong with them. But over a few days, their illness changed for the worse. The patients’ lungs filled with sticky phlegm, and they became short of breath."
72,The shuttered hospital converted to an emergency influenza clinic in the fall of 1918 was the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital of Philadelphia (Image:  http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/archives/20030322008 …) pic.twitter.com/fFBbjqZ9jO

79,"The results, as described in press reports after they were published in 2011, were “spectacular.” pic.twitter.com/4b2cl7hTNQ"
80,"A billion or so of their T cells were removed, reprogrammed with a modified, harmless HIV virus and taught to seek out that CD19 protein on cancer cells, and then infused back into their bodies to multiply and attack leukemia."
81,"By 2009, the team was ready for human testing. The NIH had declined to fund the work several times over the years. Help from private funders allowed the researchers to now conduct a small trial—just three patients."
82,He continued: “Happy to prove them wrong!”
83,"Blood cancers would be next. Michael Milone, who came to work on them as a postdoc, said, “People advised me to think carefully about working with Carl because they said the work he was doing was high-risk and unlikely to be successful.”"
84,"By the time June and @BLLPHD landed at @Penn in 1999, they had cracked the code on how to get T cells to grow outside the body, and safely infused a small group of HIV patients with first-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that enhanced their immune function."
85,"None of this seemed to discourage Carl June, MD, an immunologist who had been working with modified T cells to develop experimental HIV therapies since the mid-1980s."
86,Pharmaceutical companies had little interest. Funding was scarce. And people from other biomedical fields largely viewed immunotherapy as a low priority.
87,"The immunotherapy field was still relatively small, with few research groups around the world investigating ways to manipulate the immune system’s T cells to fight disease."
88,"It’s 2018. Young leukemia patients now can have their immune cells removed and bioengineered to fight cancer—it’s been an FDA-approved reality for half a year. But 10 years ago, this would have been a pipe dream."

330,Bekelman: It's not about rationing or global budgeting or any of that. It's about giving our biggest purchaser of drugs the tools that everyone else in the economy has. #AACR18
331,"Bekelman: I don't think this is a Republican or Democratic issue. Drugs don't work if patients can't afford them. That goes to both sides of the aisle. These three steps, they are certainly bold, but I believe that there's a will to enter them into the public discussion. #AACR18"

334,"Bekelman: With three different solutions, we can move toward a more rationalized system #AACR18"
335,Bekelman's third step: Practice guidelines should prioritize targeted cancer drugs and treatment regimens by clinical benefit and price. #AACR18
336,Bekelman: Medicare is the largest purchaser of cancer drugs in the United States. That's a dominant market position. #AACR18
337,Bekelman's second step: CMS should conduct demonstration project in which Medicare negotiates prices for targeted cancer drugs and employs formulary tools to prioritize highly effective drugs. #AACR18
338,Bekelman: This would promote innovation by setting the goal post #AACR18
339,"Bekelman: We propose the FDA develop a consensus-driven definition of meaningful clinical benefit. ASCO has already done this, endorsing a minimum absolute improvement of 3-6 months of life over best available treatment for drug trials in metastatic disease. #AACR18"
340,Bekelman: The FDA should define minimum clinically meaningful effect sizes for approval of targeted cancer drugs #AACR18
