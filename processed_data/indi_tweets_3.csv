10,One thing I simply do not understand in bladder cancer:1) some are advocating observation for T2 who are complete responders to neoadjuvant chemo 2) Many suggest cystectomy for recurrent T1 3) BUT few recommend neoadjuvant chemo for recurrent T1.  This incongruity makes no sense!

18,"Whats the equivalent of the ""Is Gleason 6 Disease prostate cancer"" with Bladder Cancer.  PUNLMP: 1) 20% recurrence rates almost always PUNLMP or low grade Ta, 2) 1% risk of progression to MIBC and this may really be new cancer not progression, 3) <1% risk of bladder cancer death."

30,Other interesting take-aways: progression to MIBC was high for truly low risk nmibc: about 2.5% in treated group and 5% in untreated group.
