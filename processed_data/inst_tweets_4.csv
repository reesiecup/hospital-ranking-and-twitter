276,"Final Q & A for #LALInclusion18: What do we do when powers-that-be are unfair in addressing structural discrimination? It's about trying to understand the motivations behind those actors' behavior or lack of behavior, replies Livingston."
277,"Livingston shows a picture, explains that different geographies, people from different cultures/backgrounds, have different frames of thought. #LALInclusion18"
278,"Livingston now going through common reasons to avoid diversity initiatives, including the ""we've already done enough,"" ""there is no pipeline and it's too hard,"" and ""willingness to invest energy."" #LALInclusion18"
279,Livingston reports a strong negative correlation among those who supported legacy admissions policies versus affirmative action policies. So opposition to affirmative action isn't about fairness. #LALInclusion18
280,"Livingston highlights difference between equality and equity. He notes people often struggle with colorblindness, striving for equality rather than equity. #LALInclusion18"
281,"Often organizations are reluctant over concerns about fairness, quality, and effort to make things happen. #LALInclusion18"
282,Livingston discussed equality vs. equity and how similarly to diversity people struggle with this - i.e. colorblindness vs. multi-culturalism. #LALInclusion18
283,Livingston is such an inspiration.  Really great guidance on how to increase diversity.   #LALInclusion18 @PartnersNews pic.twitter.com/8vZzDvJcx0
284,"Boom - there it is. Livingston highlights a clear set of diversity and inclusivity strategies. They are predicated on the sense of sacrifice: ""Am I willing to incur the tradeoff to get this right?"" #LALInclusion18"
285,Now Livingston is talking about tying awareness to strategy and action - again using his signature brand of humor to convey his meaning. #LALInclusion18
286,"The final S: Sacrifice. Are you willing to give up time? Resources? Are you willing to incur a tradeoff to get results? Organizations want diversity, but what are they willing to do to make it happen? #LALInclusion18"
287,"Dr. Livingston introduces the first ""S"" (Strategy) - without a scale, you don't necessarily realize change. Do you know there's a problem, and what's the cause?  #LALInclusion18"

291,"Livingston shares 3 orientations: individualist-seeking increased outcome to self, indifferent to others; competitor-seeking increased difference between self and others, favoring self; prosocial-seeking increased outcome for self and others in equitable manner. #LALInclusion18"
292,"Now Livingston is talking about empathy (or as he says, ""Do you care?"") #LALInclusion18"
293,Livingston notes that similarly entrenched views of gender with regard to certain traditionally masculinized college majors. #LALInclusion18

311,"What about women? Women are more babyfaced than men on average, but women CEOs are far less babyfaced than the CEO average. #LALInclusion18"
312,The data: Black CEOs were more babyfaced than other groups. Being babyfaced is an asset for Black men and a liability for White men. #LALInclusion18
313,"""Women don't need to be disarmed - they are already disarmed by the virtue of their gender."" - Dr. Robert Livingston #LALInclusion18"
314,"Being babyfaced is a liability for white males: it makes you look warm and gentle and docile, but also incompetent. But there is a crossover effect for Black males. #LALInclusion18"

689,"Good reminder from Dr. Torchiana at @PartnersNews during #BBJhealthcare Power Breakfast that per capita costs are ""holding the line"" in Mass., so we might be doing something right in the massive effort to manage costs while improving outcomes."
690,Great thoughts and insights at this morning’s BBJ healthcare power breakfast! @Rosemarie_Day1 @NEHI_News @HarvardPilgrim @PartnersNews #BBJhealthcare pic.twitter.com/rnEoUt0Q70
691,"While there is still a lot of work to do, this report is encouraging news that gives us hope that we are beginning to bend the curve of this epidemic. As a Commonwealth, we must continue our aggressive efforts to combat the opioid and fentanyl crisis. http://ow.ly/10fV30iq6yb "
692,Most promising aspect of healthcare technology? Dr Torchiana: EMR has not lived up to the promise to make care delivery more efficient- but there is opportunity in using the data and incorporating AI. @PartnersNews #BBJhealthcare @DayHealthStrat
693,Schultz: sees increased use of telehealth and telemedicine to have patients continue monitoring chronic conditions at home — “so many important uses.” #BBJhealthcare
694,Torch: sees harnessing AI and use of digital information “taking the world by storm in the next 5 years and have an impact on provider productivity.” #BBJhealthcare
695,"Day: folks in healthcare are mainly mission-driven, but I think there needs to be a spot check on that. #BBJhealthcare"
696,Schultz: we need to find a way to put pressure on pharma to align costs with benefits they bring. #BBJhealthcare
697,Torch addresses loss of revenue on provider-side. “It’s important we focus on containing cost but have enough wherewithal to deliver care. You can’t just cut — the provider side needs time...to make corrections.” #BBJhealthcare
698,Torch: the elements of employer mandates — providing adequate level of insurance to employees — and individual mandates bringing healthy and young into insurance pool — help maintain an equilibrium. #BBJhealthcare
699,Schultz: consumers are very smart when it comes to health insurance. #BBJhealthcare
700,Schultz: What we need to do is recognize unique social needs of population and have appropriate flexibility with patients and physicians — make sure it doesn’t affect patient-physician relationship. #BBJhealthcare
701,"Torch: It’s going to be a challenging startup, both on the interface side between ACO and state, but most particularly for patients to understand new paradigms and options for freedom. Ultimately a better new care model re: social determinants of health outcomes. #BBJhealthcare"
702,“The idea is to be more patient-centered and more cost-effective.” #BBJhealthcare
703,"Day: There are many flavors of ACOs, and MassHealth has grown a fair amount over the last 5-6 years. It’s a place where the government can be sponsoring and catalyzing innovation. #BBJhealthcare"
704,“It can actually help unburden the healthcare system.” #BBJhealthcare
705,"Torch: the niche of retail health sits between what people can do OTC and what actually requires a health care system. That’s the space CVS has staked out, and that space is going to get bigger. #BBJhealthcare"
706,Day: Another opportunity is to take the pharmacist from behind the wall. It tends to be a place where consumers have a lot of skin in the game. #BBJhealthcare
707,"Schultz: The opportunity with CVS is to take their retail locations, get out of the business in selling items that aren’t healthcare, and redesign to offer a variety of primary health care services. #BBJhealthcare"
708,"Rosemarie Day of @DayHealthStrat: “There is a need for some consolidation of market power on the consumer side...I think there’s been a number of moves...trying to harness collective purchasing power, including sharing their data...and can that be used for good.” #BBJhealthcare"
709,Tom Hubbard of @NEHI_News addresses CVS/Aetna merger and Amazon’s entry into the marketplace: “It’s not a consolidation we normally think of.” #BBJhealthcare
710,Schultz: “I do worry about consolidation...I think there’s a knee-jerk reaction across all industries that bigger is better...changing how care is delivered to the patient is hard.” #BBJhealthcare
711,"Eric Schultz of @HarvardPilgrim addresses the crowd on consolidation — “it’s nothing new, and the pendulum has been swinging.” #BBJhealthcare"
712,“This was really about the survivial of @MassEyeAndEar and...enables them to take advantage of the overall scope of Partners and Partners infrastructure.” #BBJhealthcare https://twitter.com/partnersnews/status/964127395858051072 …
713,Torch addresses @MassEyeAndEar history and “at this point in time...they were concerned about their economic future...a specialty organization risks its roots atrophying.” #BBJhealthcare https://twitter.com/partnersnews/status/964127056094167040 …
714,The panel kicks off with Torch being asked why the @MassEyeAndEar acquisition was important and some headwinds encountered.
