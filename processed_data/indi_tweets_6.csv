342,4)  Bill notes that he is down below listening to worship music - then feels an urgent need to do something heroic given recent drowning deaths related to intoxication - but as soon as he sees who it is he is furious?  (says it twice).  What is that emotional transition about?
343,3) Bill Hybels makes a point of being heroically concerned for the woman in the water given drowning deaths from inebriated people falling off the dock.  I couldn't find reports of that in South Haven.  Is Bill playing the hero curious to anyone but me?

482,"I also want to give a special thank you to @wartwatch @watchkeep & @Taige for believing me, for standing with me and for helping me to share my story. Your kindness and support has meant the world to me! Thank you!!!"
483,So @chrisconlee - how does blocking the people who were attempting to inform you and educate you - who did so with respect and dignity - fit into your 5 step conflict plan? Which step was that? And how is this a sermon?
484,"Will current and former @hpmemphis members and the other founding pastors - Wes, Stan, Brad hear the apology of this not being disclosed to them?  Will @chrisconlee apologize for his failing to report during statute of limitations?  #churchtoo @nytopinion"
485,"Will the victim hear the confession of grooming, prior episodes of flirting, abuse of authority, betraying her trust, contributing to how WPBC shamed her?  #churchtoo @nytopinion"
486,"‚ÄúYou want to discipline them but always give them the opportunity to learn from the discipline in order to be restored‚Äù @chrisconlee.  ICYMI - signs point to @andysavage ‚Äùrestoration‚Äù at @hpmemphis.  Will anyone but HP elders hear the confession of abuse of power, deception, etc?"
487,Second service - ‚ÄúGuard against permanent forms of discipline.‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like the Lord said to me ‚Äòstop making these permanent expressions of discipline.‚Äù  @chrisconlee.  NWT: you mean like when God tells Moses he will not enter the promised land because he failed to trust him?
488,The person who violates trust receives the benefit of ‚Äúbelieving the best about them‚Äù after they have sinned against their brother/sister and the person violated is labeled as sinful for using discernment about a pattern of behavior.  This is the preaching of @chrisconlee
489,"Preaching on trust: ‚Äúplease do everything possible to believe the best about someone - because if you believe the worst about someone then you look at everything through the lens of suspicion.‚Äù  This means that the person violated, by being cautious is now being sinful: suspicion"
490,And now... @chrisconlee:  ‚Äúforgiveness is not forgetting it is changing the way you remember it.‚Äù Because you remember from a place of healing... ‚Äú hmmm now watch this:  that means that if you remember it as sexual assault it means you haven‚Äôt forgiven or aren‚Äôt healed.
491,2/insert text # for donations here.  What happened to the ministry to help victims of abuse of authority thru sexual assault .. I mean sexual sin...?
492,Next up at Highpoint Church - God has put on @chrisconlee heart to start a 24/7 prayer center.  And an anonymous wise advisor confirmed this vision that Chris received... a gift to the entire city of Memphis.  So to grow this center - so begin the process of giving toward that...
493,@smlungpathguy This is true in medicine in general but amplified in pathology since field is relatively small.  But SoMe helps overcome this fragmentation and allows dissenting voices to be heard.
