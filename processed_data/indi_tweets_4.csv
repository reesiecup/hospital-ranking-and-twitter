19,"-Risk aversion and how docs deal with uncertainty. This is critical. A lot of decisions are driven by fear of the unknown, not direct financial incentives. -Insulation from costs. Doctors don’t bear the costs of the tests they order, and often aren’t even aware."
20,"A lot of factors influence how doctors may think and the decisions they make. -Where & how they trained. Some studies suggest if you trained in a high utilization place, those practice patterns continue-Malpractice fears. Estimates put this at 2-5 percent that may be too low"
21,"Most PCP offices don’t actually get paid for the costly services that ensue from doctor decisions, like MRIs, CTs, specialist consults. If the PCPs aren’t paid for these sometimes low value services, it’s hard to argue that financial incentives drove those decisions."

201,"Hospital patients’ survival rates don’t suffer when substitute doctors fill in, according to new research by HMS’ @AnupamBJena and @blumenthalDM1  http://hvrd.me/GmFg30hfplp "
202,Terrific thread by @amitabhchandra2 on @LisaRosenbaum17 @NEJM piece. All points are excellent but agree most with point 6 on why doctors should be applauded for not crowding out public funding for schools and infrastructure earlier https://twitter.com/amitabhchandra2/status/941665504820789249 …
203,"@NEJM @LisaRosenbaum17 7/77) The anatomy of physician behavior is more complex than we appreciate. Less is More is an important idea, particularly for a discipline where More is More has been the historic norm. The truth is somewhere in between."
204,"@NEJM 6/n6) @LisaRosenbaum17 is spot on about the roles of risk tolerance, uncertainty, where a doc trained, malpractice fears, peer effects, knowledge/skill, all being more relevant than $$$, yet payment reform focuses on, well, payment"
205,"@NEJM @LisaRosenbaum17 5/n5) The focus on fee-for-service / financial incentives has grown too strong. Most docs don't get paid to order MRIs, labs, consults, etc., so where is the financial incentive for them? For some specialists, maybe, but for most docs, practice variation minimally driven by $$$"
206,"@NEJM @LisaRosenbaum17 4/n4) The life years lost from underuse, however broad you define it, far outweigh overuse of medical care. That's not to say that we ignore harmful or low-value care, but we should recognize this likely truth."
207,"@NEJM @LisaRosenbaum17 3/n3) I suspect many docs (and most students) believe 'overuse' is the bigger problem. But millions of uninsured, rates of adherence to meds of below 50%, untreated chronic disease, decades before docs prescribe beta blockers at correct rates in heart attack patients = underuse"
208,"@NEJM @LisaRosenbaum17 2/n2) There is no doubt that low-value care is pervasive and some care is even harmful (our cardiology meetings study suggested so much wrt PCI in marginal patients), but a key question is whether the US has a bigger problem of 'overuse' or 'underuse' of medical care."
209,"Why the new piece by @LisaRosenbaum17 in @NEJM on Less is More is important and worth reading 1/n http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1713248#.WjKHLDlPaMh.twitter …1) The issue is controversial and many may not agree with the piece.

9,"Great dialogue with @JenniSchaefer and @DrJennyThomas this morning! So great, that I just had to blog about it. Why is it that saying ""she's an anorexic"" and ""He's suffering from bulimia"" is wrong? Read here! https://honestlyfree-ed.com/2018/01/29/i-am-not-an-anorexic-and-neither-are-you/ …"
10,".@aedweb @JenniSchaefer Thanks so much for a stimulating discussion!  I hope to continue the conversation and see everyone at #ICED2018 in Chicago April 19-21, 2018.  https://www.aedweb.org/aed-events/iced  #AEDchat"
11,"11a The topic of obesity is beyond the scope of the #IJED, unless it relates specifically to eating disorders. I do think a similar list could be made in that field, and would be really interesting! #AEDchat"
12,8c Also I have to point out that the gold standard is no longer in use for any modern currencies.  So not even money is on the gold standard!  Why should our treatments or measures be? #AEDchat
13,8b I also think “gold standard” falsely implies that our work is done. Even the best #EatingDisorder treatments only get half to two-thirds of people better. We have a lot of work to do still! #AEDchat
14,"8a No measure or treatment is perfect, so rather than referring to an assessment or treatment as the gold standard, it’s more helpful to describe the actual psychometric properties or efficacy data. #AEDchat"
15,"7b @JenniSchaefer and I were not aware of this in 2013 when we wrote our book #AlmostAnorexic  http://amzn.to/2DSBYDg  which uses the word “struggle” quite a bit. Again, we are working on our own language, too! #AEDchat"
16,"7a It’s really important not to infer any individual’s lived experience of an #EatingDisorder. While some individuals may feel that they are suffering or struggling, others may not. The more neutral phrase “individual with an eating disorder” is more inclusive. #AEDchat"
17,@aedweb A5. I think it limits the scope of the problem to one narrow action or behavior without seeing the entire problem or the entire person #AEDchat
18,"6b In the #EDE, the term “bulimic episode” means eating a large amount of food accompanied by a feeling a loss of control. However, nowadays most people associate the term “bulimic” with concomitant bingeing and purging, so the term bulimic episode can be confusing. #AEDchat"
19,"6a The term “bulimic episode” comes from the Eating Disorder Examination #EDE, a widely used structured interview to diagnose eating disorders, that was developed well before our current definitions of eating disorders. #AEDchat"
20,"5a Those words have specific meanings (e.g., anorexia means loss of appetite; bulimia means ravenous hunger) that are actually different from the specific disorders which have longer names (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa), so using the full name avoids confusion #AEDchat"
21,4e We suggest reconsidering the terms “refeeding” and “struggling with” or “suffering from” an eating disorder. #AEDchat
22,4b We suggest avoiding referring to individuals by a label that implies that the person is defined by the diagnosis or symptoms that they experience. #AEDchat
23,"4a You can check out the #IJED article ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084795 ), which highlights 12 terms in the eating disorder field that should be retired or reconsidered. #AEDchat"
24,"3c We can’t study what we don’t define. Now that Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder #ARFID has been added to #DSM5, our team is studying its neurobiology. Click here to learn more and see if you are eligible to take part:  https://tinyurl.com/ya9t7cso  #AEDchat"
25,"3b We can’t treat what we don’t define. When Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder #ARFID was added to #DSM5 in 2013, our clinic was inundated with treatment requests. Of course these patients had existed before but giving them a name allowed them to seek help #AEDchat"
26,"3a When clinicians or researchers refer to someone by his/her disorder, they might create a self-fulfilling prophecy suggesting that the person will always have it and will never recover. It becomes part of the person’s identity. #AEDchat"
27,We hope our list will contribute to improved clarity in scientific thinking about #EatingDisorders and stimulate discussion of terms. Terms may need to be reconsidered in our field’s vocabulary to ensure the use of language that is respectful and sensitive. #AEDchat
28,1c. Words shape our thinking about eating disorders. I myself have made some of these mistakes in the past and strive to do better in the future. #AEDchat
29,JT: 1b. Our article isn’t about criticizing anyone for the language they have used but rather recognizing that words are incredibly powerful #AEDchat
30,1a. We (editors at the IJED) were inspired by an article by former @aedweb keynote speaker Scott Lilienfeld PhD on terms to avoid in psychiatry  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26284019  We thought our field could use a similar list! #AEDchat
