DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:53:10,"11a The topic of obesity is beyond the scope of the #IJED, unless it relates specifically to eating disorders. I do think a similar list could be made in that field, and would be really interesting! #AEDchat",2,0,1,True,"#IJED,#AEDchat"
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:43:28,8c Also I have to point out that the gold standard is no longer in use for any modern currencies.  So not even money is on the gold standard!  Why should our treatments or measures be? #AEDchat,4,0,2,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:43:15,8b I also think “gold standard” falsely implies that our work is done. Even the best #EatingDisorder treatments only get half to two-thirds of people better. We have a lot of work to do still! #AEDchat,7,0,3,True,"#EatingDisorder,#AEDchat"
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:43:06,"8a No measure or treatment is perfect, so rather than referring to an assessment or treatment as the gold standard, it’s more helpful to describe the actual psychometric properties or efficacy data. #AEDchat",4,0,2,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:37:18,"7b @JenniSchaefer and I were not aware of this in 2013 when we wrote our book #AlmostAnorexic  http://amzn.to/2DSBYDg  which uses the word “struggle” quite a bit. Again, we are working on our own language, too! #AEDchat",6,0,2,True,"#AlmostAnorexic,#AEDchat"
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:37:08,"7a It’s really important not to infer any individual’s lived experience of an #EatingDisorder. While some individuals may feel that they are suffering or struggling, others may not. The more neutral phrase “individual with an eating disorder” is more inclusive. #AEDchat",1,0,2,True,"#EatingDisorder,#AEDchat"
TriciaTimney,2018-01-29,10:32:38,@aedweb A5. I think it limits the scope of the problem to one narrow action or behavior without seeing the entire problem or the entire person #AEDchat,2,0,2,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:34:55,"6b In the #EDE, the term “bulimic episode” means eating a large amount of food accompanied by a feeling a loss of control. However, nowadays most people associate the term “bulimic” with concomitant bingeing and purging, so the term bulimic episode can be confusing. #AEDchat",4,0,3,True,"#EDE,#AEDchat"
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:34:42,"6a The term “bulimic episode” comes from the Eating Disorder Examination #EDE, a widely used structured interview to diagnose eating disorders, that was developed well before our current definitions of eating disorders. #AEDchat",4,0,2,True,"#EDE,#AEDchat"
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:32:31,"5a Those words have specific meanings (e.g., anorexia means loss of appetite; bulimia means ravenous hunger) that are actually different from the specific disorders which have longer names (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa), so using the full name avoids confusion #AEDchat",4,1,2,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:24:21,4e We suggest reconsidering the terms “refeeding” and “struggling with” or “suffering from” an eating disorder. #AEDchat,2,0,0,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:24:13,4b We suggest avoiding referring to individuals by a label that implies that the person is defined by the diagnosis or symptoms that they experience. #AEDchat,6,0,5,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:24:00,"4a You can check out the #IJED article ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084795 ), which highlights 12 terms in the eating disorder field that should be retired or reconsidered. #AEDchat",5,0,5,True,"#IJED,#AEDchat"

DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:21:34,"3a When clinicians or researchers refer to someone by his/her disorder, they might create a self-fulfilling prophecy suggesting that the person will always have it and will never recover. It becomes part of the person’s identity. #AEDchat",9,2,5,True,#AEDchat
DrJennyThomas,2018-01-29,10:11:44,We hope our list will contribute to improved clarity in scientific thinking about #EatingDisorders and stimulate discussion of terms.
